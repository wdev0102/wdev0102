n the past 14 years I have worked many areas of development. I started out in PHP / Javascript / Ecommerce development. I worked to make the most of many platforms such Wordpress, Shopify, Magento 1 + 2 and others. I also designed and developed many custom platforms for clients who had requirements that exceeded the capabilities of pre-built platforms.

Over the course of completing many projects, I started to expand past web technologies and started developing more advanced / real time back end systems. I gained experience with Node.js, Python, Firebase, MongoDb and others. I also gained a good amount of experience working with React and React Native for slick front-ends.

Eventually, I started working on developing an effective Crypto trading bot. This lead to learning even more about blockchain technologies.

Now, I have moved in to Smart Contract development with experience working on multiple blockchains. Primarily ETH (solidity) and WAXP (c++), although I am familiar with many others and the requirements to work on them.

I have designed, developed, and released a NFT game project which is still on-going. I am familiar with staking, play 2 earn, tokenomics, creating game tokens, verifiable randomness and more.

Please feel free to contact me with your blockchain based projects, I am eager for more work in this area!
